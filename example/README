This directory contains a very simple example of how to use
aldoc for documenting aldor libraries.

1.) Build aldoc with the Makefile by running:

    make

2.) Copy the two files "aldoc.cls" and "ttyverb.sty" to this directory
    or anywhere where latex can find them.

3.) Run the "extract" utility:

    extract -m ALDOC example.as

4.) Run the latex compiler:

    pdflatex manual.tex

This is all, the manual is now in "manual.pdf".
